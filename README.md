# Data Centric Milestone Project

Welcome to my data centric milestone project. For this project I created an online cookbook, a web application allows users to easily view, create, update and delete recipes.

## UX

This web application will be for users who want to store their own recipes and view other users recipes.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to find recipes, so I can get some ideas of what I want to cook.
- As a user, I want to find recipes based on an spanish cuisine, so I can cook a spanish meal tonight.
- As a user, I want to find breakfast recipes, so I can get some ideas of what I can make for breakfast.
- As a user, I want to view recipes sorted by likes descending, so I can view the most liked recipes in the database easily.
- As a user, I would like to add my own recipe to the database through an easy to use UI, so other users can see my recipe.
- As a user, I would like the ability to update my recipe, so i can correct any mistakes or add a new idea to the recipe.
- As a user, I would like the ability to delete my recipe, so I can remove the recipe from the database when I wish.
